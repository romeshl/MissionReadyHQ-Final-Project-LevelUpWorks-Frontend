# MissionReadyHQ-Final-Project-LevelUpWorks-Frontend

I coded this as the final project of the Mission Ready HQ, Full-stack accelerator course - Level 4. This is my first actual *React app*. This repository only contains the frontend code for my portion of the project. 

Fully working app can be found in the github pages link below. 

[Mission Ready HQ - Final Project - LevelUp Works, Frontend](https://romeshl.github.io/MissionReadyHQ-Final-Project-LevelUpWorks-Frontend/)

Checkout **Sample Data.md** for test data.

The backend code of the app can be found at the link below. 

[Backend](https://github.com/romeshl/MissionReadyHQ-Final-Project-LevelUpWorks-Backend)

It was a group proejct and I choose *Home and Login/Signup* pages. 

More information and specs about the *Mission X* can be found in the *Mission X instructions* folder. 

The app has been made to the requirements laid out in the specification in the *Mission X instructions* folder. Some of the links are working but not all of them.

*Home page* is responsive. However, *Login/Signup* page is not responsive.

Structure of the *Home page* as below:

* Home Page
    - Home Nav
    - Home body
        * Home body section 1
        * Home body section 2
        * Home body section 3
    - Home footer

*Login/Signup* page is another component that's displayed based on the click of *Login* or *Signup* links/buttons.

*Login/Signup* component's code got longer than I expected. However, after few attempts of trying to refactor it, I decided to leave it as it is, as not to increase the complexity of the project. 

You may run,

```
npm install
```
after cloning the project to check and test the code. Thank you. üòÅüëç
